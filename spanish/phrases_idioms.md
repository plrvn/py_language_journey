* **¡Andáte!**: Go away! (Reflexive form).
* **¡Vamosna!**: Let's go! (Adding the Guaraní suffix na to make it a plea or more emphatic).
* **¡Eju!**: While this is Guaraní for "Come," you will hear it mixed into Spanish sentences constantly (e.g., "¡Eju andá!" which is a contradictory but common way of saying "Hurry up/Get moving!").
